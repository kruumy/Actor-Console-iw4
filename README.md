## What Is Actor Console?

Actor Console for IW4 clients is an external GUI application for interacting with the [IW4 Cinematic Mod By Sass](https://github.com/sortileges/iw4cine). It enables you to manage you actors more efficiently and provide an easy GUI based way to do so.

## Installation

## FAQ

- How do I change my selected precache directory?

Right click on the directory in the bottom right status bar to reset.

- The game isn't detecting if I am in a map or not...

This could be because Actor Console could not read the address to detect what map you are in. To solve this, you could force the application to believe you are in game, **Right Click** on the status text in the bottom right.
